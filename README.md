# 📊 Customer Churn Analysis – Google Data Analytics Capstone

This project is the final capstone of the **Google Data Analytics Certificate**. It simulates a real-world business scenario where a fitness subscription app aims to reduce customer churn through data-driven strategies.

## 🔍 Business Task
Identify behavior patterns that contribute to churn and provide recommendations to improve retention.

## 📁 Dataset
A simulated dataset of 1,000 users, including:
- Sign-up date, age, gender, subscription type
- Workout frequency, login history
- Churn status (yes/no)

## 🧰 Tools Used
- **Excel** – data cleaning, derived columns
- **Tableau** – data visualization and dashboard
- **PowerPoint** – final case study presentation

## 📈 Key Insights
- Users with <1 workout/week churn at **71%**
- Inactive users (60+ days without logging in) churn at **70%**
- Monthly subscribers churn slightly more than annual users

## ✅ Recommendations
- Launch re-engagement campaigns before users become inactive
- Promote annual subscriptions with incentives
- Personalize workout plans for low-activity users
